# Microcenter Rework

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in Microcenter-Rework
npx sv create Microcenter-Rework
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create the production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## Goal

Our goal for this rework is to make Microcenter more accessable and clean to use as to not deter new customers.
Through surveying people, and from personal experiences customers are willing to turn to Microcenters competitors to avoid their rather cluttered website.
We want to reduce the number of misclicks and provide users with a cleaner and fuller shopping experience when using the Microcenter website.
